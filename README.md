# Clustering-of-Large-Unlabeled-Dataset
CLUSTERING OF LARGE UNLABELED DATASETS

./K-means: presents the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm. Inside this folder, we have kmeans_language.py, created for the language analysis and kmeans.py, created for the other analysis performed.

./FeatureExtraction_MLlib : presents the methods and codes to extract the information from the database and how to use MLlib to perform K-means. The codes in this folder were used not only to produce the comparison but also to produce a Kmeans vector file, to be used with our implementation of the algorithm.

./Plotting: Here we have the plot codes together with the raw data to be plot
